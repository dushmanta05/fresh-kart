# My-Food-Website
### A responsive online food ordering web app made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- Thanks to [CodersGyan](https://github.com/codersgyan/ "Visit his GitHub"), I've developed this project with the help of his tutorial.
- Additionally, [jQuery](https://jquery.com/ "visit jQuery website") has been used for responsiveness of the website and [slick-slider](https://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/ "Visit slick-slider website") carousel for sliders in the top product section.
- Please visit https://food-online-app.netlify.app/ for complete website.
- If you appreciate this website, please give it a star, and any recommendations are welcome.
